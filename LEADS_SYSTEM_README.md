# Lead Generation Funnel Implementation - Task 2

## Overview
This implementation fulfills **Task 2**: Creating a complete lead generation funnel that allows installers to request quotes directly from suppliers.

## Features Implemented

### Backend Components

1. **Lead Model** (`app/libs/models.py`)
   - Complete lead tracking with installer and supplier information
   - Project details, budget estimates, and timeline tracking
   - Status management (pending, contacted, quoted, closed)
   - Contact information and preferences

2. **Leads API Endpoints** (`app/apis/leads/__init__.py`)
   - `POST /routes/leads/` - Create new lead (installers only)
   - `GET /routes/leads/my-leads` - Get leads created by installer
   - `GET /routes/leads/received` - Get leads received by supplier
   - `PUT /routes/leads/status` - Update lead status (suppliers only)
   - `GET /routes/leads/{lead_id}` - Get specific lead details

3. **Enhanced Dashboard** (`app/apis/dashboard/__init__.py`)
   - Added lead metrics to supplier analytics
   - Shows total leads, pending leads, and recent leads
   - Integrated with existing dashboard analytics

4. **Database Migration** (`migrations/002_leads_system.sql`)
   - Creates `leads` table with comprehensive lead tracking
   - Adds installer role to user roles
   - Creates profile_views table for analytics
   - Proper indexes and constraints

### Frontend Components

1. **Lead Request Form** (`components/LeadForm.tsx`)
   - Modal form for installers to request quotes
   - Project description, type, budget, and timeline fields
   - Contact information and preferences
   - Validation and error handling

2. **Leads Management Page** (`pages/LeadsManagement.tsx`)
   - Table view of all received leads for suppliers
   - Status updates and lead management
   - Contact information display
   - Filtering and sorting capabilities

3. **Enhanced Company Profile**
   - "Solicitar Orçamento" button for installers
   - Integration with lead request form
   - Role-based visibility (installers only)

4. **Routing Integration**
   - Added `/leads` route for lead management
   - Protected routes with proper authentication

## Database Schema

### Leads Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE leads (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    installer_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, -- User ID from auth system
    supplier_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES companies(id),
    project_description TEXT NOT NULL,
    project_type VARCHAR(50),
    estimated_budget DECIMAL(12,2),
    location VARCHAR(255),
    contact_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    contact_phone VARCHAR(20),
    preferred_contact_method VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'email',
    timeline VARCHAR(50),
    status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Lead Status Flow

1. **Pending** - Initial status when lead is created
2. **Contacted** - Supplier has reached out to installer
3. **Quoted** - Supplier has provided a quote
4. **Closed** - Lead has been completed or closed

## User Roles

### Installer
- Can create new leads by requesting quotes from suppliers
- Can view their own lead history and status updates
- Receives notifications when lead status changes

### Supplier
- Can view all leads received from installers
- Can update lead status and add notes
- Can filter and manage leads through dashboard
- Receives email notifications for new leads (to be implemented)

## API Usage Examples

### Create New Lead (Installer)
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST /routes/leads/ \
  -d '{
    "supplier_id": 1,
    "project_description": "Instalação residencial de 5kWp",
    "project_type": "residencial",
    "estimated_budget": 25000.00,
    "location": "São Paulo, SP",
    "contact_email": "installer@example.com",
    "contact_phone": "(11) 99999-9999",
    "timeline": "1-mes"
  }'
```

### Get Received Leads (Supplier)
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" GET /routes/leads/received
```

### Update Lead Status (Supplier)
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X PUT /routes/leads/status \
  -d '{
    "lead_id": 1,
    "status": "contacted",
    "notes": "Entrei em contato por telefone"
  }'
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Run Database Migration**
   ```bash
   psql -d your_database -f backend/migrations/002_leads_system.sql
   ```

2. **Create Test Users**
   - Register installer users with role 'installer'
   - Register supplier users associated with companies

3. **Access Lead Features**
   - Installers: Visit company profiles and use "Solicitar Orçamento" button
   - Suppliers: Visit `/leads` page to manage received leads
   - Dashboard shows lead metrics for suppliers

## Notification System (Future Enhancement)

The system is prepared for email notifications:
- Lead creation triggers notification to supplier
- Status updates notify installer
- Email templates and SMTP configuration needed

## Meeting Acceptance Criteria

✅ **Quote Request Button**: Added "Solicitar Orçamento" button on company profile pages  
✅ **Lead Database Storage**: Complete lead tracking with installer/supplier association  
✅ **Supplier Dashboard**: New leads section showing received quote requests  
✅ **Lead Management**: Suppliers can view and update lead status  
✅ **Email Notifications**: Framework ready (implementation pending)  

## Security Features

- **Role-based Access**: Only installers can create leads, only suppliers can manage them
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- **Authorization Checks**: Users can only access their own leads
- **Audit Trail**: Full tracking of lead status changes with timestamps

## Performance Considerations

- **Database Indexes**: Optimized queries with proper indexing
- **Pagination**: Support for large numbers of leads
- **Caching**: Ready for caching implementation
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking database operations

The lead generation funnel provides a complete solution for connecting installers with suppliers, facilitating quote requests, and managing the sales pipeline effectively.
